# AnjieStoresDB

# In this Project the idea was to create a database for a supermarket inventory management system, I implemented Normalisation techniques to reduce data redundancy in the table, I also implemented stored procedures to detect when products finish and automatically ordering from a supplier. 

# This project is still in the pipeline as I am currently building the frontend layer to fully demonstrate the idea of the database schema.


# You can reach out to me on https://www.linkedin.com/in/ayomikun-ogunjuyigbe-b32480190/ if you want to have a better understanding of the project and collaborate.
# Further updates will be added subsequently.
